# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by
# separate terms of service, privacy policy, and support
# documentation.
#
# This workflow will install genezio, then run genezio deploy for your project.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to complete the following set-up steps:
#
# 1. Create a free genezio account at https://genez.io
#
# 2. Store a genezio access token in GitHub Actions secrets named `GENEZIO_TOKEN`.
#
# See the documentation for more details and best practices.
